## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully custom Shopify theme, without the use of any starter or pre-built templates. It was designed and coded from scratch using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Liquid (Shopify's templating language)**

The goal is to replicate the experience and layout of a premium retail site (like Nike) while learning and applying best practices in Shopify theme development.
